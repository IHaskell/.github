The __IHaskell__ organization maintains the [IHaskell](https://github.com/IHaskell/IHaskell) kernel backend for
[Haskell](https://haskell.org) programming language support for 
[Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/) computational notebooks.

### History of IHaskell

[Andrew Gibiansky](https://github.com/gibiansky) started development of the IHaskell kernel in 2013. [Vaibhav Sagar](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar) took over as maintainer of the IHaskell kernel in 2017.
